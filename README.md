MovieLens Recommendation System with Autoencoder

Overview :-

This project implements a recommendation system using an autoencoder-based collaborative filtering approach. The MovieLens dataset is used to train the model, and predictions are made based 
on user-item interactions.

Dataset :-

The project uses the MovieLens dataset, which contains user ratings for movies. The dataset includes:

movies.csv: Movie metadata (e.g., movie ID, title, genres)

ratings.csv: User ratings for movies (user ID, movie ID, rating, timestamp)

users.csv: User demographic information

Data Preprocessing :-

Loading the MovieLens dataset

Converting user-item interactions into a matrix

Normalizing rating values

Splitting the data into training and validation sets

Model :-

The model is an autoencoder-based collaborative filtering system:

Encoder: Compresses user-item interactions into a latent representation.

Decoder: Reconstructs the interactions from the compressed representation.

Training :-

Loads the preprocessed dataset

Trains the autoencoder using mean squared error loss

Evaluation :-

This script calculates performance metrics such as RMSE.

Making Recommendations :-

Once the model is trained, generate recommendations using:

Loads the trained model

Predicts ratings for unseen items

Outputs top recommendations for a given user

Future Improvements :-

Implement a hybrid recommendation system (content + collaborative filtering)

Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance

Experiment with different neural network architectures
